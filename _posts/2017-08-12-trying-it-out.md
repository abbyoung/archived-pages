As I was finishing 2666 by Roberto Bolano last week, an [old article resurfaced about Long Novel Stockholm Syndrome](http://www.themillions.com/2011/05/the-stockholm-syndrome-theory-of-long-novels.html). In long novels, so much time passing with nothing exciting happening, and seemingly no redeeming writing, that when a spark, a gem comes through, we’re so grateful and convinced the book we’re reading is good. 

I do feel a bit manipulated and trapped once I’m halfway through a 1000-page book, but then I’m in it. I need to finish, to have the entire story. I’ve spent so much time in this world that I need to see it resolve, but at some point, at least in 2666, the reader gets such a strong sense of the world and its outcomes and perils and triumphs and small joys and bigger despairs, that you can almost predict the outcome, which I’m sure is intended as Bolano tends to leave the storylines hanging in midair, just enough satisfaction to make you not throw the book against the wall, but still wanting more. 

I also enjoy the mundane in long novels, at least the well-written ones. It reminds me of a description I read once of Tolstoy's writing, “It’s like watching life happen.” 

Endless paragraphs of watching life happen give me the space to reflect, see my own life looking back at me, or squinting hard at the text as if I expect a secret truth of life to jump out at me. It’s a meditation for me. I bond with my long reads. 

Recommendations: War and Peace, Anna Karenina, 2666, Crime and Punishment.
